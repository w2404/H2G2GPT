Its skin is thick and leathery, and its body is covered in dense fur that helps to protect it from the harsh elements of its home planet. Despite its formidable size and strength, the Hrung is notoriously clumsy and often stumbles around in a daze, completely unaware of the damage it is causing.\n\nOne of the most notable incidents involving a Hrung occurred when one of these creatures accidentally sat on a young family's house, completely destroying it and leaving the family homeless. This incident sparked a massive controversy and led to a public outcry against the Hrung, with many calling for the creatures to be hunted and exterminated.\n\nDespite their clumsy nature, however, the Hrung is not without their admirers. Many individuals and groups have come to appreciate the unique qualities of these creatures, citing their gentle demeanor and quirky personalities as reasons for their continued existence. Some have even gone so far as to set up Hrung sanctuaries, where the creatures can live out their lives in peace and safety.\n\nOverall, the Hrung serves as a prime example of the strange and wonderful creatures that populate the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe. Their quirky personalities and massive size make them a fascinating addition to the series and a beloved icon of science fiction culture."}
