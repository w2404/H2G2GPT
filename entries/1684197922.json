{"title": "The planet of Frastra", "content": "Ah, greetings once again! As your trusty fictional encyclopedia, I have regaled you with numerous tidbits and tales from the whimsical world of Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" But fear not, for I have not exhausted my vast repository of knowledge just yet.\n\nHave you heard of the planet of Frastra? No? Well, let me enlighten you. Frastra is a small, unassuming planet located in the outer rim of the galaxy. It is known for its abundance of rare and exotic flora, including the infamous Frastrian Poison Ivy, which is said to cause a particularly unpleasant rash that lasts for several months. Despite this rather unpleasant side effect, the plant is highly sought after by certain individuals for its purported medicinal properties.\n\nBut that's not all! Frastra is also home to a rather peculiar species of animal known as the Frastrian Firefly. These tiny creatures emit a bright green glow that can be seen for miles around, making them a popular attraction for tourists and bioluminescence enthusiasts alike.\n\nSo there you have it, dear reader. The planet of Frastra may be small, but it is certainly not lacking in charm or intrigue. As always, I encourage you to keep exploring the vast expanse of the galaxy, for who knows what wonders you may discover next."}
