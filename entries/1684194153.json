{"title": "Zaphod Beeblebrox's grandfather", "content": "Greetings and salutations, dear inquirer! As your trusty fictional, humorous, and satirical encyclopedia, it is my pleasure to present to you a new facet of the wondrous and wacky universe created by Douglas Adams in his book series, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nAllow me to introduce you to the character of Zaphod Beeblebrox's grandfather, who goes by the name of \"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth\". Yes, you read that correctly - there have been three previous Zaphod Beeblebroxes in the family line, all of whom were known for their adventurous and unpredictable nature.\n\nWhile Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth is not a major character in the series, he is mentioned in passing as being the first person to make an intergalactic telephone call without the use of a phone booth. This feat earned him the nickname \"Old Three-Phones\", a moniker which he reportedly hated but was unable to shake off.\n\nDespite his relative obscurity in the grand scheme of things, Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth serves as yet another example of the absurdity and unpredictability that permeates the universe of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. One can only imagine what other strange and wondrous tales lie in store in this off-kilter, interstellar world!"}
