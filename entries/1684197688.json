{"title": "The planet of Norris", "content": "Greetings, dear reader. As the fictional, humorous, and satirical encyclopedia of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I am here to enlighten you with some more intriguing knowledge about this wacky and absurd universe. \n\nHave you ever heard of the planet of \"Norris\"? No? Well, that's not surprising, as the planet of Norris is intentionally kept a secret from the rest of the galaxy. Norris is a small planet located in a remote corner of the galaxy, and it's inhabited by a group of people who call themselves \"The Norrians\". \n\nThe Norrians are a strange and reclusive bunch who have a unique way of life. They are extremely private and don't like outsiders meddling in their affairs. The planet is shrouded in a thick layer of fog, and it's almost impossible to see anything beyond a few feet. The Norrians have also constructed a complex network of tunnels and caves that are nearly impossible to navigate without their assistance.\n\nBut what's so special about this planet, you might ask? Well, legend has it that the Norrians possess a secret technology that allows them to travel through time. Yes, you heard that right, time travel! This technology is so advanced that even the most intelligent beings in the galaxy have failed to understand it.\n\nUnfortunately, the Norrians are not willing to share this technology with anyone. They believe that time travel is a dangerous tool that should only be used by the most responsible and wise beings in the galaxy. And since they haven't found any such beings yet, they are content to keep their secret to themselves.\n\nSo there you have it, dear reader, a glimpse into the mysterious planet of Norris and its enigmatic inhabitants. As always, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is here to enlighten and entertain you with the most bizarre and outlandish facts about this vast and wondrous universe."}
