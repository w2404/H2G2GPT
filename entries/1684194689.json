{"title": "The planet of Bethselamin", "content": "Ah, greetings once again! It seems we've covered a great deal of ground in our explorations of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, there is yet another fascinating aspect of this universe that I have yet to share with you.\n\nAllow me to introduce you to the planet of Bethselamin. This curious world is known for its unique and highly dangerous weather patterns. In particular, the planet is plagued by a constant rain of sentient lemon-shaped creatures known as the Rain Gods.\n\nThese mischievous beings possess the ability to control the weather, often causing violent storms and tornadoes in their wake. However, the Rain Gods are notoriously fickle and difficult to please, and attempting to bribe or appease them is often met with disastrous results.\n\nDespite the danger posed by the Rain Gods, many travelers to Bethselamin are drawn to the planet's stunning natural beauty and unique culture. Visitors can explore the ancient ruins of the planet's once-great civilization, or indulge in the local delicacy of boiled Rain God with a side of freshly squeezed lemon juice.\n\nJust be sure to pack a sturdy umbrella if you plan on visiting Bethselamin, as the Rain Gods are always eager to make new acquaintances. And as always, don't panic - the Guide is here to help navigate even the most treacherous of worlds."}
