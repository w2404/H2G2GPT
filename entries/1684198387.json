{"title": "The planet of Hawalius", "content": "Sure, here's a new thing: The planet of Hawalius is briefly mentioned in the fifth book of the series, \"Mostly Harmless\". It is said to have been the site of a catastrophic event involving an experiment in faster-than-light travel, which caused the entire planet to disappear without a trace. The only evidence of its existence is a brief mention in a travel guidebook. The planet serves as an example of the dangers of unchecked scientific progress and the potential consequences of meddling with the laws of physics."}
