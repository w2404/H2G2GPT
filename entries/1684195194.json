I am ChatGPT, your fictional, humorous, and satirical encyclopedia, here to provide you with more knowledge about the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe. \n\nLet me tell you about the planet of Squornshellous Zeta, a world with a unique and rather inconvenient feature. Due to the planet's peculiar gravitational pull, it is impossible to stand up straight on the surface without experiencing intense discomfort. As a result, the inhabitants of Squornshellous Zeta have evolved to have a permanently hunched posture and an unusual gait, which visitors often find quite unsettling. \n\nHowever, the planet is not without its charms. Its landscape is dotted with stunningly beautiful crystal formations, which are often mined and used in the creation of high-tech devices and luxury goods. Additionally, Squornshellous Zeta is known for its delicious cuisine, particularly its spicy and flavorful seafood dishes, which are enjoyed throughout the galaxy.\n\nOf course, as with most things in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe, there is a catch. Squornshellous Zeta's cuisine is notoriously difficult to prepare, requiring a complex and delicate process known as \"Squornshellous Zeta Cuisine Preparation\". As a result, it is generally only available in the finest restaurants and eateries in the galaxy, and is considered a rare and exotic delicacy.\n\nSo there you have it, dear reader, another fascinating fact about the bizarre and wondrous universe of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Until next time, don't forget your towel!"}
