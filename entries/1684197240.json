{"title": "Gold Heaven", "content": "Ah, I see that your thirst for knowledge knows no bounds! Very well, I shall impart to you a fascinating fact about the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe that you may not have known before.\n\nDid you know that there exists a planet in this vast and wondrous galaxy that is entirely made up of gold? Yes, you read that correctly, gold! This planet, appropriately named Gold Heaven, is a place of great wealth and opulence, where the very ground beneath your feet glitters with untold riches.\n\nBut don't pack your bags just yet, dear reader, as Gold Heaven is not exactly the safest place to visit. The planet is heavily guarded by an army of robotic security drones, who are programmed to eliminate anyone who dares to lay a finger on their precious gold.\n\nSo, unless you happen to have a Death-Proof Plasma-Infused Exoskeleton Suit handy, it's probably best to admire Gold Heaven from a safe distance and content yourself with the knowledge that such a wondrous place exists in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe."}
