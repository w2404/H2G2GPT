{"title": "The planet of Kakrafoon", "content": "Ah, yes, I see that you have been well-versed in the lore of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, there is one notable omission from your list that I must rectify. Allow me to introduce you to the planet of Kakrafoon.\n\nKakrafoon is a planet of curious qualities, located in a particularly unfashionable corner of the universe. It is known for its unique ecosystem, which includes the infamous Kakrafoon Kappa, a species of large, green, slimy creatures that live in the planet's swamps and excrete a highly addictive substance known as Kappa Essence.\n\nKakrafoon is also the site of the Great Circling Poets of Arium, a group of eccentric poets who spend their days circling the planet in search of inspiration and a good meal. They are known to recite their poetry in the hopes of attracting a meal from passing spaceships, and their poetry is said to be some of the worst in the galaxy.\n\nIn addition to its unusual wildlife and poetry-loving inhabitants, Kakrafoon is also home to the Heart of Gold's improbability drive. This drive was stolen by Zaphod Beeblebrox and installed in the Heart of Gold, allowing the ship to travel through the fabric of space and time with ease.\n\nSo there you have it, a brief introduction to the peculiar planet of Kakrafoon. Don't forget to bring a towel if you plan on visiting, as things can get quite messy around those Kakrafoon Kappas."}
