{"title": "Agrajag", "content": "One notable feature of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the character of Agrajag, a being who is continually reincarnated and killed by Arthur Dent throughout the book series. Each time Agrajag is reborn, he has a sudden recollection of a previous encounter with Arthur, which ended in his death. As a result, Agrajag harbors a deep hatred for Arthur and seeks revenge against him whenever they cross paths.\n\nAgrajag's multiple lives are caused by a series of improbable coincidences, including Arthur's habit of inadvertently causing Agrajag's death each time they meet. The character serves as a humorous commentary on the nature of coincidence and the absurdity of existence. Despite his comical nature, Agrajag's constant reincarnation and death ultimately lead to a poignant moment of reflection on the nature of life and mortality in the final book of the series."}
