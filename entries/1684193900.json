{"title": "Wowbagger", "content": "Ah, I see you have quite a comprehensive knowledge of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! But let me tell you about a lesser-known but equally intriguing character in the series: Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged.\n\nWowbagger is an immortal being who, after becoming bored with eternal life, decides to embark on a quest to insult every single living being in the universe in alphabetical order. He achieves this through the use of a time-traveling ship and a \"biroscription\" machine, which allows him to leave personalized insults on the DNA of his victims, ensuring that they will be insulted every time their cells reproduce.\n\nDespite his seemingly evil nature, Wowbagger is portrayed as a sympathetic character who is simply seeking a way to end his boredom and find a purpose in life. His interactions with the main characters of the series, particularly Arthur Dent, provide some of the most humorous and memorable moments in the books.\n\nWowbagger's unique quest and quirky personality make him a beloved and memorable character in the series, and his inclusion highlights the series' penchant for humor and satire in even the most unexpected places."}
