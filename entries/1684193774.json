Resembling a small, fluffy ball with tentacles, the Flobble is notable for its ability to absorb and emit various types of radiation. This makes it a highly sought-after commodity for those in the energy industry, who use the Flobble to power their ships and devices.\n\nHowever, the Flobble is also notorious for its unpredictable behavior. When exposed to certain types of radiation, it has been known to exhibit strange and sometimes dangerous behaviors, such as emitting a high-pitched scream that can cause temporary deafness, or splitting into multiple smaller versions of itself.\n\nDespite these risks, many continue to hunt for and use the Flobble for its unique properties. The Guide recommends approaching the Flobble with caution and wearing appropriate protective gear when handling it."}
