{"title": "Jatravartids", "content": "Sure, here's a new entry for you:\n\n\"Jatravartids\" are a species of highly religious and philosophical beings featured in Douglas Adams' book series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. They are known for their complex and often nonsensical religious beliefs, which involve worshiping a giant sneeze as the creator of the universe. According to Jatravartid belief, the universe was sneezed out of the nose of the Great Green Arkleseizure, and all existence is therefore the result of this divine nasal emission.\n\nThe Jatravartids are also known for their habit of walking under ladders, which they believe brings good luck, and their refusal to eat anything that has not been dead for at least a week, which they believe shows respect for the deceased. Despite their peculiar beliefs, the Jatravartids are regarded as a peaceful and intelligent species, and their contributions to the fields of philosophy and theology are highly respected throughout the galaxy."}
