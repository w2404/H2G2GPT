{"title": "Stavromula Beta", "content": "Ah, I see you have a voracious appetite for knowledge about the peculiarities of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Well, let me enlighten you with a new factoid about this wacky universe. Did you know that there exists a planet by the name of Stavromula Beta?\n\nYes, Stavromula Beta is a planet mentioned briefly in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, which is said to have been destroyed in a particularly creative way by the people of Krikkit. According to the Guide, the Krikkiters \"had been delighted to discover that the third planet in the Stavromula Beta system was prehistoric Earth, and had decided to rid the galaxy of all other forms of life so that they could settle down and enjoy a nice quiet existence on their very own planet.\"\n\nSo, in order to accomplish this goal, the Krikkiters built a superweapon known as the \"Wikkit Gate,\" which had the power to destroy entire planets. With the help of their newfound allies, the people of Krikkit were able to activate the Wikkit Gate and wipe out all life in the galaxy, except for themselves. However, their victory was short-lived, as they soon discovered that their own existence was rather dull and unfulfilling without any other forms of life to interact with.\n\nThus, the Krikkiters were eventually persuaded by the sentient cricket race to see the error of their ways and to join the rest of the galaxy in peace and harmony. And so, Stavromula Beta became just another footnote in the tumultuous history of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe."}
