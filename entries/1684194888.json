These beings are renowned throughout the galaxy for their remarkable ability to predict the future with startling accuracy. They possess a unique form of clairvoyance that allows them to see all possible outcomes of any given situation, and from there, they can choose the path that leads to the most desirable result.\n\nAs you might imagine, this ability has made the Hawalians very popular amongst those seeking guidance and advice. Many species throughout the galaxy have made pilgrimages to Hawalius in order to seek out the wisdom of these prophetic beings.
