{"title": "Vogon Poetry", "content": "Entry: Vogon Poetry\n\nVogon poetry is widely considered to be one of the worst forms of poetry in the galaxy. It is characterized by its extreme unpleasantness, incomprehensibility, and lack of any discernible artistic merit. The Vogons, an alien race featured in Douglas Adams' book series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, are known for their bureaucratic and unpleasant nature, and their poetry is no exception.\n\nDespite its lack of popularity among other species, Vogon poetry has been known to cause extreme discomfort and physical pain to those who are forced to listen to it. The poem \"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\" is widely regarded as one of the worst examples of Vogon poetry, and is said to have caused the destruction of a planet when it was read aloud.\n\nIn the book series, the protagonist Arthur Dent is subjected to Vogon poetry on several occasions and describes it as \"like having your brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.\" Overall, Vogon poetry serves as a humorous critique of the pretentiousness and incomprehensibility often associated with modern poetry."}
