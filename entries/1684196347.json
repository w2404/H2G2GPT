{"title": "Lintilla", "content": "One new thing from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that I haven't told you about yet is the character of Lintilla. Lintilla is a woman with multiple copies of herself, created as part of a cloning experiment that went wrong. Each Lintilla is identical in appearance and shares the same memories, but they have distinct personalities and opinions. \n\nWhen Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect encounter Lintilla, they learn that she has been traveling through space for centuries, collecting specimens and genetic material from various planets in the galaxy. She offers to give Arthur and Ford a sample of their own DNA, but they decline. Lintilla also reveals that she has a \"pan-dimensional\" boyfriend named Eccentrica Gallumbits, who is known as the \"Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon 6\" in some parts of the galaxy. \n\nThe concept of Lintilla and her multiple selves is a playful exploration of the idea of cloning and identity, as well as a satirical take on the science fiction trope of encountering strange and unusual beings during space travel."}
