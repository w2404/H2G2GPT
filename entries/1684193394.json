{"title": "The Guide Mark II", "content": "Sure, here's something new: The Guide Mark II is an advanced version of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that appears in the fifth book of the series, Mostly Harmless. It is a highly intelligent and self-aware device that is able to predict and anticipate its user's needs, sometimes even before they are aware of them. The Guide Mark II is so advanced that it is even capable of creating entire new universes, although this capability proves to be a major plot point in the book's dark and unexpected ending."}
